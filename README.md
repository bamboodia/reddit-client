# Reddit Client Portfolio Project

## Aim of the project

I'd like to use this project to further my understanding of React and Redux. I struggled a little with the previous projects so I'm hoping I can overcome those struggles here.

## Features 

### A default homepage
That displays current most popular posts without a user having to login.

### A login option
That will display the relevant users subscribed subreddit top posts.

### Upvoting and downvoting
Unsure if the API will allow this but would like to include this.

### A list of subscriptions
A relevant list of subreddits.
